Project: ml_client

	Interacts with ml_server to measure throughput and bytes received

Author: Michael Landes

	This code is for CS 8803 (GOS) GaTech Fall 2012
	There are no copywrights, no usage restrictions, and no guarentees :)

To Build:

	./make bin

Other Make Commands:

	./make clean


To Run:

	./bin/client -s server -p port -w num_workers -r num_requests -f files

-s server : name of the server on the network
-p port : port number where the server is listening
-w num_workers : how many worker threads should make a request
-r num_requests : how many requests each worker should make
-f files : number (>0) of files in the dest to examine

NOTE: the current implementation expects the server to be running in a directory
containing a bunch of files called file#.html where # is a number.
The server can serve any sort of directory, but in this client implementation the specific
directory with the specific files is expected.

Process:
	create a directory of files {file#.html} where # is 1..50 for instance
	cp ml_server/bin/server into this directory
	run the server, giving it the appropriate commands
	run ml_client/bin/client giving it the appropriate commands, with -f 50 as the num_files command

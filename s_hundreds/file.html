Evil exists. Not the mere absence of good, nor a vague, formless dread, but a real, palpable thing.  It manifests itself in death and disease, suffering and despair. Satanists and gothic bands are not evil. They are merely kitsch.  Kitsch is not itself evil, but kitsch without irony can point to evil, as indicated by the kitschy tastes of a Hitler or a Pol Pot or a Bill Gates.
